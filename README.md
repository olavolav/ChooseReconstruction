# ChooseReconstruction

A web application to allow neuroscientists that want to reconstruct structural connectivities from data, to find the best theoretical tool.

They can filter according to their theoretical requirements and according to the type of data set they have available.

The idea would be to collaborate on the categories and content, such that the result is up to date and not biased.
