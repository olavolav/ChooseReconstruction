# ChooseReconstruction

Prototype of a web application (written using [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/)) to allow neuroscientists that want to reconstruct structural connectivities from data, to find the best theoretical tool.

The idea would be to collaborative on the filter categories and content, such that the result is not biased.
